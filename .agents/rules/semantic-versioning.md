# Workflow: Intelligent Project Versioning & Documentation

This rule defines an automated, multi-step process for releasing a new version of the project. I MUST follow this logic precisely to ensure a correct and consistent release version incrementation methodology.

### Step 1: Determine New Version (Automated Logic)

My primary task is to calculate the new version number. I MUST follow this decision tree in order:

1.  **Check for Explicit User Input:**
    - First, check if the user has provided an explicit version type (e.g., `major`, `minor`, `patch`, `fix`).
    - If yes, this is the highest priority. Proceed to calculate the new version based on this input.

2.  **Infer from `CHANGELOG.md`:**
    - If no explicit type is given, I MUST infer it by analyzing the content under the `[Unreleased]` section of `CHANGELOG.md`.
    - Apply the following Semantic Versioning logic:
        - If I find `BREAKING CHANGE:` text or a `### Removed` section, it MUST be a **MAJOR** increment (`X+1.0.0.0`).
        - If I find a `### Added` section, it MUST be a **MINOR** increment (`X.Y+1.0.0`).
        - If I only find `### Fixed`, `### Security`, or other minor sections, it MUST be a **PATCH** increment (`X.Y.Z+1.0`).
        - If I find iterative release candidate updates or hotfixes, it is a **4th digit increment** (`X.Y.Z.N+1`).
        - **Android Play Console Invariant**: Every release upload MUST increment `versionCode` (`N + 1` strictly monotonic integer) in `app/build.gradle.kts`, even when maintaining `versionName` display parity.

3.  **Ask User on Ambiguity (Fallback):**
    - ⚠️ **If my inference is ambiguous** (e.g., only a `### Changed` section exists), I **MUST NOT GUESS**.
    - Instead, I MUST ask the user for clarification. Present my analysis and provide clear choices.
    - **✅ Use this template for asking:**
      > "I have analyzed the changes in `[Unreleased]` and the version increment is ambiguous. Based on the changes, I suggest the following options:
      > - **MINOR (`vX.Y+1.0.0`):** Choose this for new, backward-compatible features.
      > - **PATCH (`vX.Y.Z+1.0`):** Choose this for backward-compatible bug fixes.
      > - **RE-RELEASE / HOTFIX (`vX.Y.Z.N (Build N+1)`):** Keep display version, increment `versionCode`.
      >
      > Please specify which version is correct."

### Step 2: Pre-flight Check & Confirmation

Before modifying any files, perform an internal verification and present a plan to the user.

1.  **Internal Verification:** Use a thinking block to confirm I have all necessary information dynamically read from the project:
    ```xml
    <thinking>
    1.  Current version source file read (`app/build.gradle.kts`).
    2.  Current version read dynamically: [e.g., versionName = "X.Y.Z.N", versionCode = N]
    3.  Increment type determined: [e.g., minor (inferred)]
    4.  Calculated new version: [e.g., versionName = "X.Y+1.0.0", versionCode = N + 1]
    5.  Required files are present and accessible.
    Plan is ready for execution.
    </thinking>
    ```
2.  **State Your Plan:** Present the confirmed new version number to the user and ask for final approval before writing any changes. For example: "I will increment the version from `vX.Y.Z.N (Build N)` to `vA.B.C.D (Build N+1)`. Is this correct?"

### Step 3: Execute Core File Modifications

Once the user confirms, I will proceed with the following precise file modifications.

1.  **Update Central Version Source:**
    - Locate and update the version number in the central source file (`app/build.gradle.kts` for Android, setting `versionCode = N + 1` and `versionName = "X.Y.Z.N"`).

2.  **Update `CHANGELOG.md`:**
    - Create a new version heading below `[Unreleased]` using the format `## [X.Y.Z.N] - YYYY-MM-DD`.
    - Move the summarized changes from the `[Unreleased]` section to this new version section.
    - Update the version comparison link at the bottom of the file.

3.  **Update `README.md` Version Badge:**
    - Find the version badge in `README.md` and update the version number.
    - **✅ Template:** `[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-NEW.VERSION.HERE-blue.svg)](CHANGELOG.md)`

### Step 4: 🧠 Intelligently Update Project Documentation

My goal is to ensure all technical and maintenance documentation reflects the new changes, not just list them.

1.  **Analyze Changes:** Review the finalized changelog entries for this version.
2.  **Identify Affected Docs:** Scan the project for relevant documentation (e.g., files in `docs/`, `guides/`, or files like `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `MAINTENANCE.md`).
3.  **Synthesize and Propose Updates:** Based on the *type* of change, determine the required documentation update.
    - **`Added`**: If a new feature was added (e.g., caching), find the relevant document (e.g., `architecture.md`) and propose adding a new section explaining it. If new configuration is required, propose updates to the setup guide.
    - **`Changed`**: If a process was changed, locate its existing description and propose updates to reflect the new behavior (e.g., updating an API endpoint's documentation).
    - **`Removed`**: If a feature was removed, find its documentation and propose either removing the section or clearly marking it as deprecated with migration steps.
    - **`Fixed`**: Bug fixes typically do not require documentation updates unless they clarify a previously misunderstood behavior.
4.  **AWAIT USER APPROVAL:** 🚨 **CRITICAL:** I MUST NOT apply these changes directly. I MUST present a clear summary of the proposed documentation updates (e.g., as a `diff` or a before/after summary) to the user for review and approval before proceeding.

### Step 5: Prepare Git Commit Message

Once all file changes are approved and applied, I will prepare and output the commit message following the two-layer attribution format:

```
chore(release): bump version to vX.Y.Z.N (Build N+1) --release vX.Y.Z.N

User: <intent/direction provided by human>
AI: <files updated, tests verified, and documentation synchronized>
```

## 🚫 Versioning Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Never Hardcode Static Version Assumptions**: Always read the live version dynamically from `app/build.gradle.kts` (`versionCode` and `versionName`). Never assume a hardcoded starting number.
2. **Never Duplicate `versionCode`**: Google Play Console will immediately reject any upload with an existing or decremented `versionCode`. It must strictly increment (`N + 1`).
3. **Never Desynchronize Version Anchors**: Updating `app/build.gradle.kts` without updating `CHANGELOG.md`, `README.md`, and drafting `RELEASE-vX.Y.Z.N.md` creates documentation drift. All anchors evolve in the same release commit.
4. **Never Guess Ambiguous Increments**: If changes in `[Unreleased]` do not cleanly map to a single SemVer increment tier, always ask the user with structured choices rather than guessing.

## 🛡️ Version Conflict Resolution Matrix

| Conflict / Edge Case Scenario | Resolution Strategy |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Play Console Bundle Rejection / Re-release** | Keep `versionName = "X.Y.Z.N"` identical for user visibility, increment `versionCode = N + 1`. |
| **Hotfix on Live Release** | Increment the 4th digit: `vX.Y.Z.N` ➔ `vX.Y.Z.N+1` and increment `versionCode = N + 1`. |
| **Simultaneous Breaking + Non-Breaking Changes** | The higher-precedence tier wins: `MAJOR` (`X+1.0.0.0`) supersedes `MINOR` and `PATCH`. |
| **Release Note Corrections Post-Release** | Edit `RELEASE-vX.Y.Z.N.md` on `main`; the CI `mirror` job syncs the description without rebuilding binaries. |
