# 📱 ShellGuard-TOTP — Android Authenticator Application

[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-v0.0.0.2-blue.svg)](CHANGELOG.md)

> **Tagline**: *"Store and generate 2FA verification codes on your device."*  
> **Model**: Standalone Android Authenticator Client for the ShellGuard Secrets Vault Ecosystem.  
> **Target Tooling**: Google AI Studio (Android Application Build Mode).

## 🎯 Executive Summary & Product Vision

**ShellGuard-TOTP** is a hardened, privacy-first Android authenticator application engineered specifically for the ShellGuard ecosystem. Built on the architectural paradigm of the **Bitwarden Authenticator**, this client is not the heavy, full-featured password manager vault; rather, it is a streamlined, hyper-responsive **2FA companion app**.

### Core Value Proposition
1. **Targeted TOTP Synchronization**: Automatically connects to the user's self-hosted ShellGuard web server, retrieves vault entries (pearls) that contain `totp_secret` seeds, and securely decrypts them on the client.
2. **Offline-First Cryptographic Cache**: Cached 2FA tokens remain encrypted locally inside a hardware-backed SQLCipher Room database. If the server goes offline or the device is disconnected, **the authenticator continues generating valid 6-digit/8-digit codes seamlessly without requiring re-authentication or active network access**.
3. **Delta Sync & Server Reconciliation**: Whenever a network connection is detected, the app performs a silent delta sync—pulling newly added TOTP entries, updating edited credentials, and pruning deleted records from the local cache.
4. **Zero-Knowledge Invariant**: Plaintext TOTP seeds are never transmitted across the network, never logged to disk in plaintext, and never exposed to background telemetry.

## 🛡️ Security Invariants

1. **Memory Cleansing**: Decrypted TOTP secret char arrays and byte buffers must be overwritten/zeroized immediately after code generation.
2. **Flag Secure**: All Activity windows must declare `FLAG_SECURE` to prevent screenshotting and screen recording by untrusted applications.
3. **Local Encryption**: All Room SQLite database tables on disk must be encrypted with SQLCipher using a key derived from the Android KeyStore.
4. **Independent Operability**: The app must operate 100% autonomously without internet once initial sync is complete.
